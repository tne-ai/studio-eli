Rate of Sale shows units sold per store per week (calculated using the last 3 periods only).

We have already sold an average of 212 of each product, with the best product selling 424 units.

Our recommendation is for procurement to order more of these products, and for the inventory specialist to allocate more shelf space for them.

Note: The products in this report are ranked using a compound score of recency of introduction and rate of sales. Products are first filtered to exclude those with low sales (less than 5 per week), undesirable range segments ("Carryover EOL"), limited sales history (fewer than 3 weeks selling), or excessive age (more than 30 weeks selling). The remaining products are then ranked based on their rate of sale and how recently they were introduced.
